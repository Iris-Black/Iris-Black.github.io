## My comments on the devices used:
|**Technique**|**Examples**|**Individual Explanations**|**General Explanation**|
|---|---|---|---|
|  Imagery (+Tone, Simile-3) | 1.“She was a senior at Woodlawn High School in Baltimore County in Maryland. She was Korean. She was smart, and beautiful, and cheerful, and a great athlete. She played field hockey and lacrosse. And she was responsible.” 
2.Adnan's in a maximum security prison in western Maryland. He calls me at my request about twice a week. He talks to me from a bank of eight pay phones in the rec hall, a pretty large room where other guys are sitting at tables with metal seats attached to them playing chess or cards or using the microwave or watching TV.
3.“... is that he has giant brown eyes like a dairy cow. That's what prompts my most idiotic lines of inquiry. Could someone who looks like that really strangle his girlfriend? Idiotic, I know.”
|1.This short imagery of Hae is used to introduce the listener to the world of this story, and the main heroine. It is also used as a segue later on to justify the reason her  family was worried when she had been missing for only a couple of hours - because she was responsible and she hadn’t done what she had to do, along with disappearing.
2.The reason this description is here is to push the readers into the prison mentality, and help them understand the sort of environment a prison is
3.While another description of his eyes may have had less of an effect, by likening his eyes to those of a dairy cow it creates a more prominent image and implies he looks dumb, but the good-willed kind of dumb. She uses the tone of her voice to voice decorate the sentence as her thought, saying it in a different overall tone from the rest of the paragraph, she separates the sentence.
|Imagery in this episode is used mainly for exposition: teaching the listeners about the people and the places in the story. Even if in the third example it is used for helping the listeners understand the state of mind Sarah was in when she first saw Adnan, it is still exposition as it is our first introduction to a physical image of Adnan.|
