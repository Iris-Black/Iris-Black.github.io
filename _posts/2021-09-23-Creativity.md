## What exactly is creativity?

In IB's opinion, it is being able to infer hidden meanings in bodies of work.
In my opinion, it is being able to peel the layers of the world.

### What would you like to learn about creativity?
I don't want to learn about the concept itself. I'd like to learn more about arts, so I can understand everything itself.

### Examples of Creativity
There are many, however the one I feel closest to right now is an artist I've discovered recently, Alberto Giacometti. I love his nihilistic paintingsÂ and how they help us understand the layer below what we see normally. The way they're drawn, and the way they're interpreted.

### What I understand from this example (The video below)
After listening to the start of it (I haven't finished it yet), what strikes me the most is how it changes your perspective. How something as common and simple as a cinema is so different when you're looking at it from a creative perspective, from the perspective of an artist.
