## What exactly is creativity?
In IB's opinion, it is being able to infer hidden meanings in bodies of work.
In my opinion, it is being able to peel the layers of the world.

### What would you like to learn about creativity?
I don't want to learn about the concept itself. I'd like to learn more about arts, so I can understand everything itself.
