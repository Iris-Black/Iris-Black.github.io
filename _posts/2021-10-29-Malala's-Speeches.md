### My thoughts on Malala as a person
[![Malala Yousufzai](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Shinz%C5%8D_Abe_and_Malala_Yousafzai_%281%29_Cropped.jpg/220px-Shinz%C5%8D_Abe_and_Malala_Yousafzai_%281%29_Cropped.jpg)](malala.org)

While I doubt anybody would dismiss Malala's achievements as trivial, it is honestly hard for people like me who have been born in a country where women have rights and isn't war-torn. The Turkish like to whine about Turkey; and while it certainly isn't paradise, I think all can agree it is in a much better state than Pakistan. That is certainly why I believe her achievements are big. 

#### Rome wasn't built ~~in a single day~~ by one person
While Malala's achievements are certainly impressive, I would like to point out that they weren't achieved by her only, and her father was a big help in them; which is a fact that I think often gets overlooked when talking about her. In one of her own speeches, she thanks her father for "not cutting her wings", but I believe he has done more than that. Not only providing her with education since she was a child, he has also helped save her after she was shot. 

### Her speeches 
If I have to be honest, I didn't like that we had to analyze her speeches for a school assignment. I think making us read/listen to them was a good choice, even analyzing them to some degree, however; staying too much on them made the experience bitter for everyone, in my opinion.

### All that ends well is well
While the paragraph above still holds true, I'm still satisfied with reading the speeches, as they have provided me with a different perspective.
