### My thoughts on Malala as a person

While I doubt anybody would dismiss Malala's achievements as trivial, it is honestly hard for people like me who have been born in a country where women have rights and isn't war-torn. The Turkish like to whine about Turkey; and while it certainly isn't paradise, I think all can agree it is in a much better state than Pakistan. That is certainly why I believe her achievements are big.
