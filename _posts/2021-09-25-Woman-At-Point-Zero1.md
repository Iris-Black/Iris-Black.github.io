## Woman At Point Zero Chapter 1

#### 25th of September 2021

### General Thoughts
	The first chapter of Woman at Point Zero was... disturbing for me. The way the author talks and thinks especially, how she ranks people the moment she sees them and tries to place herself above all the time. But compare that with her lack of self-confidence, and you see something that's painfully obvious: Because of her lack of self confidence she thinks the people she meets are above her, and to compensate for that she tries to rank people by logic to make her ranking go higher.
