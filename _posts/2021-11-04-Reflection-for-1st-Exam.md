### Reflection

#### Criterion A

- I repeated myself for 1 issue - I couldn't find another aspect
- I have demonstrated that I understand some details that contribute to the issue, with my points, however I could've added more for the dissemination of the facial expressions of the people in the documentary.
- I had already talked about how long this has been going on, so I should've written down another point for "She is just my wife."

For Knowledge, I think I have landed somewhere between 7 and 8. Ms. Taylor may not.

#### Criterion B

- I have not much description, but a lot of interpretation. I also have some analysis, along with some good ideas.

Out of 6, I had analysis 1 out of 6 times..? Maybe 2..?

- I could've analyzed the consequences and reasons of why this has been accepted in the community of Pakistan.

- I could've analyzed why even some who don't value said values still can't act.

- I could've been more clear when analyzing, with talking about the impacts of what I've been saying more. I should've been, generally; more clear and more specific. I should've talked more about the impacts and the importance of my points.

For Analysis, I think I have landed somewhere between a 5 and a 6..?
