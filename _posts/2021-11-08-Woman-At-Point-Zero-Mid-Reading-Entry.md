### Key Concept: Identity
- I have learned that people's identity can be negatively affected by positive interactions 
- Woman At Point Zero has helped me come to this realization by showing Firdaus and her relationship with Miss Iqbal
> “Before leaving school for the last time, I kept looking around me, sweeping walls, windows, doors with my eyes unceasingly, expecting something to open suddenly and reveal her eyes, as they looked out at me for a moment, or her hand waving a usual farewell.”

- As a global issue, I have "Emotional pressure and abuse in restricted cultures".
- Because of the effects of emotional pressure on Firdaus's mind and her personality, I have extracted this global issue. I still have questions on the way to qualify a culture as "restricted" or something as "emotional abuse".
