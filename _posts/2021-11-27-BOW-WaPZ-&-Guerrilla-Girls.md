### Woman At Point Zero and Guerrilla Girls

#### Global Issue
- Objectification and difficulties women face in the workplace

#### WaPZ Stylistic Choice

- Irony, Juxtaposition, Comparison
> "I came to realize that a female employee is more afraid of losing her job than a prostitute is of losing her life."

> "For my meagre salary did not permit me to live anywhere else than in this house."

> "Nor was [my body] considered the price I was supposed to pay in order to gain my director's good will, or avoid the chairman's anger." 

#### Guerrilla Girls Stylistic Choice

- Wording of the message - usage of "thou", "shalt", etc. and the points made

#### Conveying the Issue Similarly
- They convey this issue similarly in that they both say there is a problem in the workplace about the objectification and abuse of women.  

#### Conveying the Issue Differently
- While woman at point zero conveys the issue of unequal standing in the workplace through the comparison made with prostitution, the Guerrilla Girls take a more direct approach and order the reader to stop the unequal practices.
