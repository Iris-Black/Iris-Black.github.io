## Global Issue
- The lack of self-confidence created by impositions of society on people

### 'Aha!' Moment

- Understanding the lack of self-confidence is caused by perhaps the Egyptian society.

- I didn't understand why she was so infatuated with Firdaus, but people are inherently attracted to people who radiate confidence, like Firdaus.

> What sort of woman was she? Since she had rejected me, did that mean she was a better person than me? But then, she had also refused to send an appeal to the President asking him to protect her from the gallows. Could that signify that she was better than the Head of State?

> Compared to her, I was nothing but a small insect crawling upon the and amidst millions of other insects.

### Saadawi's Attitude Towards The Warden & My Global Issue

- The fact that the warden is closer to Firdaus ~ Makes Saadawi go crazy
- She tries to falsify the warden's claims by comparing their societal status ~ inferiority complex

### Insights That Are Already Offered

- The state of women in Egyptian, and thus backwards-minded, societies.
- The injustice in the justice system
