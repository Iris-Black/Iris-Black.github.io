This is a cartoon about the COVID-19 virus and its effects on society.

### In the first panel:
- Word choice
	- Descriptions like "wild-eyed", "selfish toff" and "morally bankrupt" make the reader expect all is going to be declared guilty, as these are all negative connotations.
    - However, the "poor person" described is labelled as the reason of the pandemic, which defies expectations --> A parallel to society, just like how it is absurd poor people are labelled as the reason for covid in our societies, it is also absurd here.
    - Why... of course! --> Like it is obvious 
### In the second panel:
- Word choice 
	- "...nice err... not as poor people?" --> This sentence makes it seem like the speaker is not on the side of poor people, and if the ones they pass the illness on are "nice people" that means they are not nice people, by connotation.
    - However, the second and third bubbles support poor people and say labelling them as the cause for Covid is wrong, which defies expectations once again. This word choice here could be used to show the inherent bias present even in people who do say poor people aren't to blame here.
- Change in perspective
	- "...you!" --> points fingers
