## Body of Work

![First Dog On The Moon Caricature](https://firstdogonthemoon.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/TheMoralOfTheCovidStory-800x1304.jpg)

This is a cartoon about the COVID-19 virus and its effects on society. 

### In the first panel:
- Word choice
	- Descriptions like "wild-eyed", "selfish toff" and "morally bankrupt" make the reader expect all is going to be declared guilty, as these are all negative connotations.
    - However, the "poor person" described is labelled as the reason of the pandemic, which defies expectations --> A parallel to society, just like how it is absurd poor people are labelled as the reason for covid in our societies, it is also absurd here.
    - Why... of course! --> Like it is obvious 

### In the second panel:
- Word choice 
	- "...nice err... not as poor people?" --> This sentence makes it seem like the speaker is not on the side of poor people, and if the ones they pass the illness on are "nice people" that means they are not nice people, by connotation.
    - However, the second and third bubbles support poor people and say labelling them as the cause for Covid is wrong, which defies expectations once again. This word choice here could be used to show the inherent bias present even in people who do say poor people aren't to blame here.
- Change in perspective
	- "...you!" --> points fingers to the reader, even if it was referring to the speaker in the first panel in the context of the cartoon
   	- A message for those who read the paper and think like this

### In the third panel:
- Statistics
	- The third panel gives information about the issue to help support their point
    - However, the names of the bars in the statistic shown beside the speech bubble indicate irony - They are named as "Franking Credit Valley" and "Robodebt Gardens" --> Thus indicating this is not a real statistic graph, but one put here for impact --> Which does not subtract from its meaning, but makes this cartoon a bit more biased.
- Rhetorical Question
	- The answer to the question "Whose fault is that?" is given in the header / headline of the cartoon already - it is the government. This line here is used to reiterate the point of the speaker.
    
### In the fourth panel
- Word Choice
	- Labelling the speaker as "person in charge" --> subtracts this from the person and links it to the position - "person in charge". This makes it so the statement of the author is directed towards governments or people in charge in general, not just a specific politician.
- Drawing style
	- The half-closed lids imply a sleepy and "braindead" state --> Which shows the authorities's unthinking state about this matter
    - This contrasts with the "!" in the speech bubble - shows politicians try make it seem like they care even when they don't. --> But anyone who observes carefully can tell they don't actually care.
    
### In the fifth panel
- Irony 
	- "Covid is very good at being a virus" 
    - As Covid is a virus, this is an ironic statement as it states what is already known about Covid - also says "clearly", which emphasizes one of the main themes of the cartoonist - we see what is in front of us - it is painfully obvious, yet we do not react on it.
- Premier(?)

### In the sixth panel
- Not much to analyze here.

### Below the panels
- A punchline 
	- Leaves a big effect on the reader with the bold statement that people are bad even without covid - makes them inquire further about the author's comics
