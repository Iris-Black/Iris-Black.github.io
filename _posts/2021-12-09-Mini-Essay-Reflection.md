### Criterion A
Lots of students did not follow the prompt
Thesis statements attempted to answer the prompt

### Criterion B
Most students are starting to understand how to limit extensive summary of the text
Quotes did not always provide substantial information, proving to be less than useful
Selection of quotes and examples did not always offer an opportunity for analysis or
extended discussion
Discussion after quotes often repeated the quotes verbatim or lacked focus on the
contents of the quote
Ideas were not always supported by the evidence, making ideas less convincing
Topic sentences should connect to the overall thesis statement and provide an argument
Too much overview in between points was provided (and therefore, making it difficult
to follow)

### Criterion C
Lots of students did not follow the prompt
Responses for the most part provided an introduction that fully introduced the text, characters, and features to be discussed
Too much overview in between points was provided (and therefore, making it difficult
to follow)
Many responses used topic sentences
Topic sentences should connect to the overall thesis statement and provide an argument
Majority of the responses crammed lots of information into one PEEL paragraph, which
often weaken arguments, and even caused a loss in focus - this can be attributed to
students having too much time to complete the task

### Criterion D
Run-on and fragmented sentences indicate students need to reread their work, and work
on using punctuation marks

#### Things I could do better

- I had too many ideas for an essay that wanted one specific aspect - lowered the focus of my thesis.
- My quotes were too long - giving short, concise, focused and juicy quotes is more important for proving your thoughts.
- One of my quotes was't very suited for proving my point - a word devalued it. Even though the explanation for it was given in my mind, I didn't give a reasoning as for why the usage of "his" by Firdaus actually means women (using the "he" pronoun for people in general). I knew it in my head, but if I wanted to use that I had to prove it, which would lengthten my paper. So, I could just exclude it and explain my point with the rest of the quote.
- Identify features in the body.
- Purpose needs more focus - very little attention to the prompt
- No Close Analysis - Avoid overview and telling the basic meaning of the quote, and closely analyze the word choice
- P2 is disconnected & its point is very similar to P1. Progress the points, not mirror them, add on top of the first P.
- Word choice could be better & more _precise_ or _sophisticated_.
