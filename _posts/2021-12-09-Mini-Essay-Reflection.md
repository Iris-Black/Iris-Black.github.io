### Criterion A
Responses for the most part provided an introduction that fully introduced the text, characters, and features to be discussed
Lots of students did not follow the prompt
Majority of the responses crammed lots of information into one PEEL paragraph, which
often weaken arguments, and even caused a loss in focus - this can be attributed to
students having too much time to complete the task

### Criterion B
Most students are starting to understand
how to limit extensive summary of the text
Quotes did not always provide substantial information, proving to be less than useful
Selection of quotes and examples did not always offer an opportunity for analysis or
extended discussion
Discussion after quotes often repeated the quotes verbatim or lacked focus on the
contents of the quote

Ideas were not always supported by the evidence, making ideas less convincing

### Criterion C
Too much overview in between points was provided (and therefore, making it difficult
to follow)
Many responses used topic sentences
Thesis statements attempted to answer the prompt
Topic sentences should connect to the overall thesis statement and provide an argument

### Criterion D
Run-on and fragmented sentences indicate students need to reread their work, and work
on using punctuation marks
