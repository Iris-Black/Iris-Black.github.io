### How important is cultural and historical context to the reception and production of a text?

- Cultural and historical context is taken into account when receiving information, as that is how humans communicate in daily life as well. For example, when someone says "I gotta go," and you've talked with them about an appointment they've had, you understand they are talking about it when they mention that they've got to go. This is true for everything. When talking about thanksgiving, the information known before is crucial to one's understanding.
 
- Culture and history manipulates information in a way for it to fit one's thoughts. An event that seems insignificant may be significant to another, and a portrayal of an event represents how the author sees that event itself, which is affected by their culture and history.

- For example, for Native Americans, prior knowledge of what happened in thanksgiving, possibly through stories told by their parents; changes it to a day of sorrow, even if the whole country is full of joy. Perhaps they receive those celebrations as an insult, or as a celebration of the day or the times when they were enslaved.

- Because of Joy Harjo's culture and knowledge of her history, representation of Native Americans and other minorities plays a big role in her poems. She chooses to focus on these topics, because of her historical knowledge and emotions.
