### How do texts reflect, represent or form a part of cultural practices?

#### Things to consider:
- Focus on represent, reflect, or form separately
- How do you know that the story does that?
- Could it be a mixture of all of them?
- What cultural practices can you deduce from the stories reflected, formed, or represented?

	Texts reflect past cultural practices and culture, but they also form the culture of future generations and teach them the old culture. Meaning, stories aim to pass on knowledge, so they are created reflecting that time's culture. However, as those same stories will teach future generations what they have inside them, they also form parts of cultures. Not only that, they represent what a culture is to other communities.

#### Story focused: The Origin of Races, 2nd Edition

- In "The Origin of Races", we see a sense of inferiority embedded in Native American culture.

- By ranking humans as White People > Native Americans > Black People; they accept their defeat against the Europeans, while seeing black people as even lower, possibly to feel better.

- By stating the white could read and the natives couldn't, and saying the natives didn't know; they put themselves lower on an intellectual level. Why?

- As the natives didn't even know the white and the black even existed before they came to the Americas, this myth must have been formed after the colonial invasions. Thus, it is a product of a culture formed by exterior means, by the Europeans. 

- While it does not represent the native people of the old, it represents the culture of the Natives affected after the invasions. It may also have been manipulated by the European people, seeing its self-degrading nature. 

- That is because cultural stories, by their nature, form the personalities of the children who listen to them. If it _was_ manipulated, it was to enforce the idea that white people are superior to Native Americans to next generations.
