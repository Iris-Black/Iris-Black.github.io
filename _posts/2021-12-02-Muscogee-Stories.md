	Answer the AoE question:
    	How do texts reflect, represent or form a part of cultural practices? 

### How do texts reflect, represent or form a part of cultural practices?

#### Things to consider:
- Focus on represent, reflect, or form separately
- How do you know that the story does that?
- Could it be a mixture of all of them?
- What cultural practices can you deduce from the stories reflected, formed, or represented?

- Texts reflect and represent past cultural practices and culture, but they also form the culture of future generations and teach them the old culture.
