### How do texts reflect, represent or form a part of cultural practices?

#### Things to consider:
- Focus on represent, reflect, or form separately
- How do you know that the story does that?
- Could it be a mixture of all of them?
- What cultural practices can you deduce from the stories reflected, formed, or represented?

	Texts reflect past cultural practices and culture, but they also form the culture of future generations and teach them the old culture. Meaning, stories aim to pass on knowledge, so they are created reflecting that time's culture. However, as those same stories will teach future generations what they have inside them, they also form parts of cultures. Not only that, they represent what a culture is to other communities.
