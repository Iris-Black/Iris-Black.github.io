### Global Issue - Minorities' lives being controlled and affected by the authorities, the majority

> "...6th Avenue jail, of mostly Native and Black men,"

- I believe this one is pretty obvious. The jail being full of mostly Native and Black men is a clear showing of the discrepancy in the states of the different races of people.

> "...where Henry told about being shot at eight times ar a liquor store in L.A. ... no bullet holes, man, and eight cartridges strewn on the sidewalk."

- This part talks about why the people in the jail are in there. The narrator's friend, Henry, being shot at when in the 6th avenue, but not being _aimed_ at, indicates he was probably caught in a crossfire. This can be interpreted as conflict between two parties, and considering the distribution of people in the jail, at least one of parties is composed of Native and/or black men.

- Author's thoughts: Usage of "man" -> assimilation and usage of culture of the Americas today. Author's feelings - decreases impact and makes it seem like the author doesn't care

	In contrast, there are also people who aren't labelled as criminals but are still living miserable lives. 

> "On a park bench we see someone's Athabascan grandmother, folded up, smelling like 200 years of blood and piss, her eyes closed against some unimagined darkness, where she is buried in an ache in which nothing makes sense."

> "...and know it is all happening."

- Detail: This is all happening when the narrator knows about all of it - contributes to the severity - people are aware of the issue but do not act upon it
