### Global Issue - Minorities' lives being controlled and affected by the authorities, the majority

> "...6th Avenue jail, of mostly Native and Black men,"

- I believe this one is pretty obvious. The jail being full of mostly Native and Black men is a clear showing of the discrepancy in the states of the different races of people.

> "...where Henry told about being shot at eight times ar a liquor store in L.A. ... no bullet holes, man, and eight cartridges strewn on the sidewalk."

- This part talks about why the people in the jail are in there. The narrator's friend, Henry, being shot at when in the 6th avenue, but not being _aimed_ at, indicates he was probably caught in a crossfire. This can be interpreted as conflict between two parties, and considering the distribution of people in the jail, it can be deduced that at least one of parties is composed of Native and/or black men.

- Author's thoughts: Usage of "man" -> assimilation and usage of culture and language of the Americas today. Author's feelings - decreases impact and makes it seem like the author doesn't care, by using street language

	In contrast, there are also people who aren't labelled as criminals but are still living miserable lives. 

> "On a park bench we see someone's Athabascan grandmother, folded up, smelling like 200 years of blood and piss, her eyes closed against some unimagined darkness, where she is buried in an ache in which nothing makes sense."

- The Athabascan grandmother, who is not a criminal, is "smelling like 200 years of blood and piss". This long-going discrimination is acting on not only the people who rebel, but also who do not. There is also the specific mention of Athabascan instead of saying Native, indicating again the location of North America. However, this might also be a bias of my European - Old World point of view, as I do now know whether they call themselves "Natives".

> "...and know it is all happening."

- Detail: This is all happening when the narrator knows about all of it, which contributes to the severity: people are aware of the issue but do not act upon it, even when the ones that are in that situation are of their kind. The main irony here is that the narrator mentions accepting and carrying the story of the grandmother, while not taking any action to help her. This might be an indication of the hipocrisy of some Native Americans, or perhaps, the unable state of the Natives that are in good shape to help others who are having hard times, because of society's or the government's prsesure.

#### Imagery
>"...blood and piss,"

- Piss has been used as an indicator for extreme poverty for centuries. There is even the saying "piss-poor". So if the grandmother was only covered in piss, that indicates she is poor and dirty. Mind that this depiction is from the narrator, and we do not know whether the grandma is really in that bad of a shape. However, considering the assumed Native origin of the narrator, it seems logical to assume they are speaking the truth.

- However, she is also smelling of blood, which indicates struggle and/or work. This means she has tried to escape from her situation, however, she has ended up with, as a result of her struggle, blood and piss; along with having to sleep on a bench. Considering she isn't in jail, she probably has tried a peaceful way of resisting, which has resulted in this. And since they actually give food and have showers in jail, it can be concluded that the peaceful protestor ends up in a worse state.

#### Structure

>"where she is buried in an ache
in which nothing makes
                                       sense."
                                       
- The pain that the grandma is in doesn't make sense, as she has tried to escape and escape but it all resulted in her misery. The placing of the word here also creates an echoey sound in the reader's mind, as single speakers in empty rooms create echoes, which amplifies the lone aspect of the grandmother's dream.
