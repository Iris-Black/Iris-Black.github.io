### Comprehension & Interpretation: 

#### Content- What is the article about? 

It is about how poverty and inequality in the Carribean regions amplify the disastrous effects of, well, natural disasters.

#### Purpose- Why was it created?


It was created to inform people in more countries that are better off, to point attention to the issues and raise help.

#### Message- What is being communicated?

Because of the past colonialist activity in the Carribean region and the actions undertaken to halt the development of said islands, the effects of natural disasters that would've already hit there are amplified, making it harder for the people there to recover.
    
#### Feature 1

- Use of images 
	- Induces empathy

    - Gives details that words may fail to give - makes those details more impactful
    	- Details such as the state of the environment and the belongings of said people, and their fear from understood from their poses.

#### Feature 2

- Word choice
> "...with little left over for greeting Irma and Maria..."
	- As the hurricanes are named after names of people, the word "greeting" creates harmony 
	- "greeting" --> use of said word implies the coming of said hurricanes is something to be celebrated or is something positive, which creates irony.

#### Feature 3

- Radical claims and contextual information 
	- The claims being made about natural disasters hitting harder because of inequality and colonialism don't make sense - surely one is separate from the other, right? The article says not exactly, and it proves that by providing information of said inequalities and making connections between them and the disasters.
    
    	- For example, women are more psychologically impacted than men and women in other countries because of the societal roles imposed on them in said communities.
        - Another example is harder recovery due to the state colonial practices have left the Carribean countries in.


### Global Issue(s)
1. Effects of colonialism halting the development of Post-colony countries
2. Women's societal roles in undereducated and poor countries

### Joy Harjo:

#### Poem - In Mystic:
> Over six hundred were killed, to establish a home for God’s
people, crowed the Puritan leaders in their Sunday
sermons.

- Word Choice
	- "Crowed"
    - "their"
    	- These words separate the colonialists from the natives, as a result of their actions.
        
#### What is the difference between the two author’s commentary on the issue? 
While the authors of the article focus on proving their point with facts and data, Joy Harjo tries to affect and talk to the emotions of the reader for said issue.

Moreover, while the authors of the article talk about the results of acts of colonialism in order to fix the problems that arise from it today, Joy Harjo talks about and focuses on the moments it was happening (in this poem) to pass on the emotions felt by the Native Americans to the readers; in order to, again, push the readers into action to solve problems that were commented. 

#### What is the main similarity in their commentary? 
In the end, both authors are from a timeframe in which several hundred years have passed since the first actions, but the effects are still felt to that day. This makes both of their main objectives to help the current victims of said actions in some way - which is pushing their readers into helping actively or protesting.

#### What effect does the article have on the reader? What is the reader’s response? Do you think this is what the writer intended?
The article leaves the reader feeling apathetic and responsible - even though they weren't the ones who did said colonialist actions directly, as they are probably living in a nation that is relatively better the language of the article and contents push the readers into feeling responsible. The responses can range from momentary shame then normalness to perhaps donating to said countries or campaigning for them. The latter results are probably what the author has intended to do, considering the nature of the article.
