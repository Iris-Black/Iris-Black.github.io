How important is cultural or historical context to the production and reception of a text?

How do we approach texts from different times and cultures to our own? 

How does the meaning and impact of a text change over time? 

In what ways is meaning discovered, constructed and expressed?

Albert Camus's _The Plague_ was written in 1947, telling the story of a pandemic in a village/town. It's a pandemic that is passed on through rodents, similar to the Bubonic Plague. I've decided to read it in consideration of the current pandemic that's been happening around the world, COVID-19. 

In a way, Camus's _The Plague_ is more relevant today than when it was written. I consider it was written by Camus after he experienced the Spanish Flu, or the Third Plague; and while the Third Plague wasn't _finished_ by then, it was weaker than when it started. So, it wasn't written in a world in the middle of a pandemic.
