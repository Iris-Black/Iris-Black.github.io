### Questions to explore

1) How important is cultural or historical context to the production and reception of a text?

2) How does the meaning and impact of a text change over time? 

The other day I picked up a book from our school's library called "Physics experiments with PCs". It was an action without much thought; I saw "physics", I saw "PCs", and I picked it up. What I didn't give much consideration to was, however, the relevancy of the book. In the computer science space, in which everything is progressing so rapidly, a 10-year-old book is considered a historical relic. The book I found was from 1995, so it was practically a prehistoric rock.

The book, which was a pioneer in its time, now uses programs archived in computer science museums. This relates to the 1st question in a natural way - the reception of this well-crafted book is poor today as science has progressed. 

There are, however, different types of information contained in a book. As this book is not about computer science in general, but is also about physics; it includes mathematical formulas to model the real world. These formulas still hold true, meaning if you wanted to reproduce the results in a modern environment, you can. Thus, the importance of historical context and time period considered depends on the type of the information and/or the text.  

#### An answer to question 2:

As this book includes full instructions for writing the code needed to perform the simulations with the PCs of the time period, it was released as a "follow-along" or "tutorial" book.
