### How do I feel 
This screenshot is the perfect representation of how I was feeling whilst listening to the nonsense some people were saying in the documentary, and I like how it shows she feels the same way.

### What is the director communicating?
I believe what she's trying to communicate is how Saba really feels about forgiving her father and her uncle. The only reason she's forgiving them is societal pressure, not any other. We understand this by the inclusion of the part where she's rolling her eyes, even when she's not talking.

### Global Issue
- Communal pressure, communal backwards-minded thinking

### How does the shot illustrate the Global Issue?
This global issue is shown with this shot through showing her suppressed emotions, through showing how she feels and highlighting the contrast between what she's saying and what she's feeling.

### How do I feel 
This shot is a calm one, one that is a very stark contrast with the story being told when it is shown.

### What is the director communicating?
I believe the director is trying to say here that even when there's something as violent as the story being told here going on, Saba's story; the world still rolls, it continues as it would. Even the landscapes where those events are happening can be much calmer.

### Global Issue
- Ignorance, turning a blind eye

### How does the shot illustrate the Global Issue?
It could be that this is, perhaps, a metaphor for the bigger picture, and how people are turning a blind eye to what has been happening in Pakistan for decades.

### Documentary Techniques:
- Cinema Verite
- Cross-cuts

#### Cinema Verite
The scene where the first lawyer of Saba is talking with the neighborhood elders is a great example of cinema verite being used to tell the global issue of communal pressure. Through the recording of this conversation that these people have between them it becomes clear how the elders are pressuring Saba to forgive her father and her uncle, as it is literally being told by the elders themselves.

#### Cross-cuts
The cross-cuts being used where the story of Saba being thrown in the river explained help amplify the effect of what has been happening then; moreover, the calm shots added between the running in the woods also help tell that the world is going on normally outside of their problems, that people do not care or know the suffering that Saba was experiencing back then. Another thing that helps this narrative are the shots of normal landscapes seen between the POV's of Saba escaping.
