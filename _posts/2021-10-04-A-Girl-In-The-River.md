### How do I feel 
This screenshot is the perfect representation of how I was feeling whilst listening to the nonsense some people were saying in the documentary, and I like how it shows she feels the same way.

### What is the director communicating?
I believe what she's trying to communicate is how Saba really feels about forgiving her father and her uncle. The only reason she's forgiving them is societal pressure, not any other. We understand this by the inclusion of the part where she's rolling her eyes, even when she's not talking.

### Global Issue
- Communal pressure, communal backwards-minded thinking

### How does the shot illustrate the Global Issue?
This global issue is shown with this shot through showing her suppressed emotions, through showing how she feels and highlighting the contrast between what she's saying and what she's feeling.
