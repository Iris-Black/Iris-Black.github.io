### Weaknesses
- My topic setences were weak and were without good arguments
- I was not focused - my thesis needs to be shorter
- I needed to put more examples for some of my points
- I may have repeated myself unnecessarily(wasn't written)
- Some of my points remained unproven
- I shouldn't have used figurative language in a formal essay
- The starting and the ending point of my paragraphs needed to be more clear
- I should have used PEEL more
- My messages should have been clearer
- I needed to be more specific

### Strengths
- Some of my points were good!
- I had nice ideas
- The proofs I had were good - they just needed to come earlier
- Some of my words were at the correct places - meaning they were approved
- My interpretation was good as well! I just needed to heed PEEL (Introduce ideas before explaining them)
- My conclusion got a tick
